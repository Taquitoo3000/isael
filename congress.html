            <h3>II Brazilian Workshop on Soft Matter - International Centre for Theoretical Physics SAIFR (2025)</h3>
            <img src="img/conferences/1000110874.jpg" width="400px">
            <p>In 2025, I had the opportunity to present my research at the ICTP-SAIFR.
                This conference is a prestigious event that brings together researchers and practitioners
                from around the world to discuss the latest advancements in biological computational physics.
                During my presentation, I shared my findings on the adsorption dynamics of dimers in a fluid and their
                interactions with heterogeneous walls.
                The feedback and discussions that followed were invaluable for further refining my research and exploring
                new avenues for investigation.</p>
